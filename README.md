# CMML3_ICA1
## Code and Scripts

All PyMOL-based structural analyses were conducted using the script `pymol_script.pml` provided in this repository. This includes:

- Interface selection and coloring
- Mutation site highlighting
- Hydrogen bond and salt bridge measurement
- Interface-local RMSD alignment

The models used are based on homology modeling (SWISS-MODEL), refinement (FlexPepDock), and AlphaFold-Multimer predictions.
